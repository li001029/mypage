      <h1>Jiafeng Li</h1>
      <p >I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University with good knowledge of software development.
        I built this website to learn and practice react.js.
           I love programming and building practical software with teamwork, and would love to make a career 
           in software engineering. I spend most of my spare time outdoor, biking, hiking, snowboarding, 
           paintballing, kneeboarding, you name it. I am very passionate about travelling, 
           youâ€™ll find me in a different place every once in a while.</p>
