      School. With the senior thechonology director of the school as our mentor, our small team worked on building a web application

      <div className='infotext'><b>University of Minnesota (UMN)</b> presented unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunity. My three years
       of undergraduate study there pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview.<br/><br/>Majoring in Mathematics is never
        an easy thing, and I remember all those nights working on complicated analysis and partial differential equation problems.
        However, it is those experience in understanding complex concepts and implementing them that made me a tenacious problem solver.
        I also took computer science core courses during my undergraduate, including data structure and algorithm, data base systems, and 
        artificial intelligence. Those coursework has set a solid base for my research work and internships.<br/><br/>During my 
        undergraduate, research is my anthem outside of coursework. I collaborated with Professor Jeff Calder and Professor Peter
         Olver on a project <a href="https://amaaze.umn.edu/"><i>Reassembly and Classification of Broken Bones</i></a>.
          We aimed to classify the break agent of broken Bones
         through analyzing bone fragments data by machine learning algorithms. I mainly worked on classification part and my job included
         building a data pipeline to clean, enrich data, and eventually fit data into machine learning algorithms. We achieved a 72% classification
         accuracy, but we hoped to reach a higher accuracy by changing the way of collecting bone data. Our collegues from anthropology
         department are still working on data collecting part. The research work definitely reinforced my programming skills and boosted
         my interest in making a career in software sector.<br/><br/>My experience at UMN is so unique. I made so many good friends here 
         from different backgrounds, and they have changed my life expectation and world view. Now with all my connections built through
         UMN, I can travel to Hongkong, Malaysia, LA, SF, Dallas, Boston, Denver Mississippi and Minnesota with free accommodation, haha.</div>

      <div className='infotext'>I am currently a graduate student at <b>Cornell university</b> working on my master's degree in 
      <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/programs/meng-degree-ithaca"> Operation Research and Information Engineering</a>,
